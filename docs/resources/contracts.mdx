# Spore Contracts

[Spore Contracts](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract) is the implementation of the Spore Protocol on [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/). It contains a set of core contracts built upon Rust as [type scripts](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/reference/script/#type-script), as well as type definitions and utilities, such as ID validation, serialization/deserialization for Rust.
