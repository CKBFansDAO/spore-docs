## Features

- ‚ö° Composed APIs for efficient spores/clusters interactions with minimal time overhead
- üß© Joint APIs for building advanced transactions as a fun block-building process
- üõ†Ô∏è Versatile utilities for encoding/decoding data of spores/clusters
- üéπ Fully written in TypeScript

## Getting started

### Installation

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
```

```shell
npm i @spore-sdk/core
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
```

```shell
pnpm add @spore-sdk/core
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
```

```shell
yarn add @spore-sdk/core
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Building browser env dapps

The Spore SDK is built on top of [Lumos](https://github.com/ckb-js/lumos), an open-source dapp framework for Nervos CKB. Lumos incorporates certain Node-polyfills into its implementation, such as `crypto-browserify` and `buffer`, to provide specific functionalities.

If you intend to use the Spore SDK in a browser environment, it's important to note that you may need to manually add Node-polyfills to your application. This ensures that the Spore SDK functions properly in the browser. For detailed instructions on how to add these polyfills, refer to the Lumos documentation: [CRA, Vite, Webpack or Other](https://lumos-website.vercel.app/recipes/cra-vite-webpack-or-other).

## Development

### Running in Node.js

If you want to use the Spore SDK in a Node.js environment, there's no extra step needed after the installation.

- For beginners, you can follow the [Creating Your First Spore](/tutorials/create-first-spore) tutorial to learn about spore creation and how to sign a basic transaction with the [CKB Default lock](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c).
- For advanced developers, you can search for code examples in [Spore Examples](./examples).

### Building web applications

If you want to use the Spore SDK in a browser environment, such as building web applications with Vite/CRA/Next, etc.,
you may need to follow the instructions of [Setup Node-polyfills](#setup-node-polyfills) to ensure the Spore SDK can function properly in your project.

- For beginners, you can start by following the [Create Simple On-Chain Blog](/tutorials/create-on-chain-blog) tutorial, a comprehensive guide on how to build a dapp, including wallet integration.
- For more application demos with the Spore SDK, refer to [Spore Demos](./demos).
