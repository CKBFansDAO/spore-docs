# Create Clustered Spore

In this recipe, you’ll learn how to tag a [Cluster](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-cluster) when creating a [Spore](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-spore). If you are looking to create standalone spores (spores without cluster) refer to: [Create a Spore](/recipes/create-spore).

:::caution

- You can only utilize a Cluster as a tag if it can be unlocked by you to use. 
- You cannot tag a Spore after its creation; you'll need to melt and then tag it during the creation process.
- Each Spore can be associated with only one Cluster.

:::

Your target cluster can be either a [public cluster](/recipes/create-private-cluster) or a [private cluster](/recipes/create-private-cluster), depending on its lock script.

## Create Clustered Spore With ClusterID

You can tag a spore with a cluster by specifying the `data.clusterId` when calling the `createSpore` API from spore-sdk:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await createSpore({
  data: {
    contentType: CONTENT_MIME_TYPE,
    content: CONTENT_AS_BYTES,
    // highlight-next-line
    clusterId: CLUSTER_ID,
  },
  toLock: OWNER_LOCK,
  fromInfos: [SPONSOR_ADDRESS],
});
```

- `data.clusterId` - The ID of the cluster to be assigned to the spore. The cluster's ID is equivalent to the type script args of the cluster.

## Create Clustered Spore With Cluster Agent

You can tag a spore with a cluster by referencing `ClusterAgent` when calling the `createSpore` API from spore-sdk:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton, outputIndex } = await createSpore({
  data: {
    contentType: CONTENT_MIME_TYPE,
    content: CONTENT_AS_BYTES,
    clusterId: CLUSTER_ID,
  },
	clusterAgentOutPoint,
  toLock: OWNER_LOCK,
  fromInfos: [SPONSOR_ADDRESS],
});
```

- `data.clusterId` - The ID of the cluster to be assigned to the spore. The cluster's ID is equivalent to the type script args of the cluster.
- `clusterAgentOutPoint` - The `ClusterAgent` you want to reference in the transaction
