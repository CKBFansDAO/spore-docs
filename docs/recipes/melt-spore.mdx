## Melt a Spore

You can melt a regular spore using the `meltSpore` API from [spore-sdk](https://docs.spore.pro/resources/spore-sdk):
```tsx
import { meltSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await meltSpore({
  outPoint: {
    txHash: '0x76cede56c91f8531df0e3084b3127686c485d08ad8e86ea948417094f3f023f9',
    index: '0x0',
  },
  fromInfos: [OWNER_ADDRESS],
});
```

- `outPoint` - Specifies the spore you want to melt, identified by its transaction hash and index.
- `fromInfos` - The transaction's sponsor, specifies where to collect capacity from.

## Extras

### Code example

For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction skeleton and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to melt a spore using [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):
