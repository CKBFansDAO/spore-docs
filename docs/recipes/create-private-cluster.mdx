# Create Private Cluster


A cluster serves as an on-chain organizing tool that groups spores together. In the recipe, you will learn how to create a private [cluster](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-cluster) that is secured by an owner lock and requires signature verification to unlock. E.g., the [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c).

To create a public cluster that anyone can pay an unlocking fee to tag spores with it, check out: [Create a Public Cluster](/recipes/create-private-cluster).

## Create a Private Cluster

You can create a private cluster with the `createCluster` API from [spore-sdk](/resources/spore-sdk):

```tsx
import { createCluster } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await createCluster({
  data: {
    name: 'Name of the cluster',
    description: 'Description of the cluster',
  },
  toLock: OWNER_LOCK,
  fromInfos: [SPONSOR_ADDRESS],
});
```

- `data` - The cluster's data, including name and description.
- `toLock` - The lock script specifies the new cluster's ownership.
- `fromInfos` - The transaction's sponsors, specifies where to collect capacity from.

## Extras

### Code example

A cluster creation transaction involves 3 steps: construct, sign, and send. This recipe focuses on the transaction construction. For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to create a cluster using [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):

### Immortal by design

Clusters are immortal by design, it means all clusters, once created, exist permanently on-chain, and not even their owner can destroy them from the blockchain.
