# Transfer Cluster Proxy

In this recipe, you will learn how to transfer ownership of a [cluster proxy](/glossary/terms#cluster-proxy) using the [spore-sdk](https://docs.spore.pro/resources/spore-sdk). Owning a cluster proxy doesn’t grant ownership of the referenced [cluster](/glossary/terms#cluster) or the [cluster agents](/glossary/terms#cluster-agent) created from it.

## Transfer a Cluster Proxy

You can execute a transfer using the `transferClusterProxy` API from spore-sdk:

```tsx
import { transferClusterProxy, getClusterProxyById } from '@spore-sdk/core';

const clusterProxyCell = await getClusterProxyById('0x<cluster_proxy_id>');

let { txSkeleton } = await transferClusterProxy({
  outPoint: clusterProxyCellOutPoint,
  minPayment: n, // Optional & modifiable
  fromInfos: [SPONSOR_ADDRESS]
  toLock: RECEIVER_LOCK_SCRIPT,
});
```

- `outPoint` - Specifies the target cluster proxy for the transfer, identified by its transaction hash and index.
- `minPayment` - An optional payment feature. If undefined, it's disabled. If defined, a minimum of 10^minPayment shannons is required as payment directed to `toLock` for using this ClusterProxy.
- `fromInfos` - The transaction's sponsors, specifies where to collect capacity from.
- `toLock` - The lock script of the new owner/recipient of the cluster proxy.

## Extras

### Code example

For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to transfer a cluster proxy with [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):
