# Transfer Spore

In this recipe, you will learn how to transfer a [spore](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-spore) to another owner. This process allows you to change the ownership of a spore.


## Transfer a Spore

You can execute a transfer using the `transferSpore` API from [spore-sdk](https://docs.spore.pro/resources/spore-sdk):

```tsx
import { transferSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await transferSpore({
  outPoint: {
    txHash: '0x76cede56c91f8531df0e3084b3127686c485d08ad8e86ea948417094f3f023f9',
    index: '0x0',
  },
  toLock: RECEIVER_LOCK_SCRIPT,
});
```

- `outPoint` - Specifies the target spore for the transfer, identified by its transaction hash and index.
- `toLock` - The lock script of the new owner/recipient of the spore.

## Extras

### Code example

For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to transfer a spore with [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):
