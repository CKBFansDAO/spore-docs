# Create Spore

In the recipe, you will learn how to create a [spore](/basics/spore-101#what-is-a-spore) on-chain using the [spore-sdk](/resources/spore-sdk).

## Create a Spore

You can create a spore with the `createSpore` API from spore-sdk:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await createSpore({
  data: {
    contentType: CONTENT_MIME_TYPE,
    content: CONTENT_AS_BYTES,
  },
  toLock: OWNER_LOCK,
  fromInfos: [SPONSOR_ADDRESS],
});
```

- `data` - The spore's data, including file data relevant properties.
- `toLock` - The lock script specifies the spore's ownership.
- `fromInfos` - The transaction's sponsors, specifies where to collect capacity from.

## Extras

### Code example

A spore creation transaction involves 3 steps: construct, sign, and send. This recipe focuses on the transaction construction. For a valid on-chain transaction, you'll need to sign the transaction and send it to the chain.

Here's a code example for how to create a spore with [`CKB default lock`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_sighash_all.c):

### Modify the Zero-fee Transfer feature

The Zero-fee Transfer feature enables recipients to transact spores without additional costs by reserving a tiny amount of CKBytes as fee for future transactions. When creating a spore, the default is to allocate 1 CKB (100,000,000 shannons) as capacity margin to cover about 100,000 future transaction. To adjust the margin amount for the new spore, you can set the `capacityMargin` prop, for example, to 2 CKB like this:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';
  // highlight-next-line
import { BI } from '@ckb-lumos/lumos';

let { txSkeleton } = await createSpore({
  ...
  // highlight-next-line
  capacityMargin: BI.from(2_0000_0000), // 2 CKB
});
```

### Configure transaction size limits

By default, spore-sdk limits the size of spore creation transactions to be `≤500KB` (500 * 1024 bytes), any spore creation transactions exceeding the size limit will not succeed.

You have the option to lower the limit when calling the `createSpore` API:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await createSpore({
  ...
  // highlight-next-line
  maxTransactionSize: 400 * 1024,
});
```

Or pass a `false` to disable the limit:

```tsx
import { createSpore } from '@spore-sdk/core';

let { txSkeleton } = await createSpore({
  ...
  // highlight-next-line
  maxTransactionSize: false,
});
```
