# Why Spore Protocol

Spore protocol prioritizes the content value of digital assets. It allows for “fully on-chain” digital assets free from format restrictions, grants holders full control over their assets, and enables innovative interactions through the network’s storage-token, a valuable and finite resource.

At the core of Spore’s motivation lies the principle of digital assets’ content value. In traditional NFTs, digital creations are no more than proxies for value, similar to paper money or cheques. They merely *symbolize* worth, but fall short to *encapsulate* the actual value of their content.

Spore seeks to reshape the digital asset landscape by redefining digital assets ownership. With Spore, owning digital assets equals to owning something akin to real “gold”, as well as the various derived values associated with it.

To achieve this, Spore leveraged “capacity”, the underlying storage space, into its design. This ensures that the digital content encapsulated in a Spore genuinely holds value. In essence, minting a Spore is more than creating an NFT — it's acquiring capital. This capital, represented in CKBytes, the native token of the CKB network, secures ownership and reserves a portion of the network's resources to safeguard your creation.

This approach intrinsically establishes a “one-to-one” connection between content and value, eliminating the need for third-party exchanges or any external certification procedures. It underscores Spore’s commitment to trustlessness and decentralization.

## Spore’s key features include:

- ### Intrinsic token value (✨*unique*)
    
    Every Spore carries inherent value, quantified in CKBytes, anchored in the network's limited resources and confirmed by its proof-of-work consensus. This makes Spores more than just NFT collectibles; they become valuable digital assets.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
- ### Redeemable token value (✨*unique*)
    
    Due to the inherent "one-to-one" connection between content and value, Spore users can destroy their Spores to immediately reclaim the remaining value anytime at zero cost.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
- ### Zero transaction fee (✨*unique*)
    
    Minting a Spore means acquiring CKBytes, securing ownership and reserving network resources. Any subsequent transaction costs are directly deducted from this balance, ensuring smooth transfers and distribution.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
- ### Fully on-chain storage
    
    Spore exclusively stores the metadata — not just a tokenID — of the your NFTs, eliminating the need for external storage solutions like IPFS or Arweave.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
- ### Immutable data
    
    Once minted, your Spore's metadata remains immutable and tamper-proof, securing the essential attributes that defines your NFTs securely locked on-chain, such as ownership, provenance, and metadata. This approach differs from ERC-721, which only defines an interface, leaving the behavior of ERC-721 tokens ambiguous until their code is examined.
    
    <br/><br/>
    
- ### Diverse and extensible content formats
    
    Spores allows users to embed various data types in their digital creations, including images, audio, video, text, and custom data structures.
    

### Possible uses cases include:

- Decentralized social network memberships
- Trustless transaction certificates
- Source code module storage platform
- Freely assembled collage NFTs
- ...
