# Getting started

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the Spore Protocol to create an on-chain blog. With the Spore Protocol, you can store your blog posts fully on the blockchain and allow others to access them. Following my footsteps will realize a simple on-chain blog, just like the online demo I deployed here: [https://spore-blog-tutorial.vercel.app](https://spore-blog-tutorial.vercel.app/)

Here is the code repository that goes along with this tutorial: [https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial). You can view or checkout different branches to see the code at different stages. I will also let you know which branch corresponds to each stage when it ends.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's take a look at the technology stack used in this tutorial:

- **Next.js**: We'll use Next.js as our framework to quickly set up our project.
- **React**: We'll use React to handle some simple view logic, but feel free to use any other framework you prefer.
- **Spore SDK**: This TypeScript SDK is based on Lumos and allows us to interact with the Spore Protocol.
- **Lumos**: A powerful Nervos CKB dapp framework used to interact with CKB.

First, we need a scaffold to build upon. For this tutorial, we'll use Next.js as the foundation for our project. You can clone the basic project code by running the following command:

```bash
git clone -b 00-base https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-blog-tutorial.git
```

In the project directory, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. You can then access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) and see "Hello World" displayed on the browser.
