# Create Your First Spore

Imagine having complete ownership and control over your digital content, stored securely on a decentralized blockchain, without relying on external URLs or third-party platforms. That's the power of Spore Protocol!

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to create your very first spore from scratch.

Before we begin, let's take a quick look at this example:

  className="margin-top--sm margin-bottom--lg"
